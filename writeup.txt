ECSC round 3 writeup
====================

(c) <guenter.ebermann@htl-hl.ac.at>

This is a writeup for an exploit written during european cyber cecurity challenge round 3.
The task was to use a race condition in the kernel to get arbitrary code execution in kernel space.
All this needed to be exploited by writing a user space program (see user/exploit.c).

1. spam kalloc() from two processes
2. detect leaked allocs by kfree()'ing from one process.
   Detection works because kfree overwrites the page with all 0x01
3. info: the freelist links are stored in the page itself
   poison the next pointer in the page we still hold.
   Set the poison to the physical address of the user process's pagetable.
4. kfree() the page we still hold (double free)
   We can again detect if the double free is executed because sbrk
   memsets the memory to all 0x00.
   this results in our next pointer being set to the top of the freelist.
   the next kalloc() will memory map the physical address we want!
   And the address we want is the pagetable. Because controlling the
   pagetable means we can/will have access to everything.
5. kalloc() from userspace.
   info: the kernel pagetable maps the whole memory 1:1!
   Now we got a R|W memory mapping to the pagetable
6. modify the pagetable so that we can overwrite kernel text segment.
7. overwrite a syscall with our shellcode (see user/shellcode.S).
   info: the shellcode uses qemu semihosting feature to call system on the host!
   call system("cat /home/user/flag").
8. execute the shellcode by calling the patched syscall.
   info: I used `sys_write` because it was the only syscall aligned on 16 byte boundary.

I also thought about using the trampoline or the trapframe for the exploit.
Problem with trampoline its only mapped X by kernel.
Problem with trapframe is there is a different one for each user thread. And its not mapped by kernel at all.
Owning the pagetable is surely the easiest way to go.
